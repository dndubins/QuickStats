Rather than install a .ZIP version of this library, this standalone version is a bit of a simpler idea. You just save "QuickStats.h" from this directory in the same directory as your sketch, it will load in a separate tab in the Arduino IDE, and then you can follow the syntax in "example.ino" to call the functions.
